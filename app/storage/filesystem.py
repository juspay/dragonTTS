"""Filesystem blob store — content-addressed, sharded (ab/cd/<key>).

No in-process cache: hot reads are served by the OS page cache (kernel-managed,
self-invalidating), which makes an application-level LRU redundant — it only saved
~tens of μs over a page-cache hit, cost 64MB of heap, and its invalidation was a
correctness hazard. Bound the pod's memory with a k8s limit so the kernel caps the
page cache under pressure.

Writes ``fsync`` the file so the blob is at least as durable as the metadata row that
references it — ``cache/service._store`` writes the blob BEFORE committing metadata, so
a crash can never leave a row pointing at a missing/truncated blob.
