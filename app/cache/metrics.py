"""Write-behind metrics: defer the stats-only HIT writes off the read path.

A cache HIT currently awaits a SQLite ``touch_and_record`` (a WAL commit) before
returning audio. This batches those updates — per-key touch sums + summed metric
deltas — and flushes them on an interval, a batch threshold, or shutdown, so a HIT
returns audio without waiting on the DB writer.

Stats-only: a crash can lose at most one flush-window of *counters* (never wrong
audio — the cache row itself is unchanged, and the correctness-critical writes
``put`` / ``put_with_totals`` / ``delete`` / ``adjust_totals`` stay synchronous on
the metadata store).
